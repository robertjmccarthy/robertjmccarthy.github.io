    <p class="profile">An ex-colleague, and friend, recently asked if I could join a call to help with some questions that their new team members had about a project I had worked on in the past.</p>

    <p class="profile">I felt a bit chuffed to be honest. Even after all this time I felt happy that I could add some value to the project.</p>

    <p class="profile">But, why? The project hadn’t been a great one. Most would call it a disaster (some publicly have). And upon looking back, I know I was suffering with major burnout throughout.</p>

    <p class="profile">I’d given it my all; regularly doing 10-14 hour days trying to deliver production-level design work whilst influencing budget holders for the oh-so-obvious need for a multi-disciplinary team, always meeting ridiculous delivery requirements whilst also doing all I could to champion for user-centred-design. And then there was also the small thing of welcoming a new baby into my young family. Lovely times marred by some tough times.</p>

    <p class="profile">It really was tough, there’s no doubting it, and others on the team suffered. Some probably still are. I might still be.</p>

    <p class="profile">I’m not going to go into the details of the problems but know that there were many.</p>

    <p class="profile">Looking back, it's obvious the team wasn’t set up for success. Far from it.</p>

    <p class="profile">I have thoughts on why. Many, many, many thoughts. None of which would be professional to write about. Or maybe, none of which I’m ready to professionally write about… yet.</p>

    <p class="profile">Coming off the recent call with my friend and their fresh-faced team, I immediately started to wonder if they’re now set up for success. Do they have a chance? I really hope so. The burnt out cynic in me suspects not.</p>
