    <h3 class="profile-heading">The challenge</h3>

    <p class="profile"><a href="https://www.colchester.gov.uk/">colchester.gov.uk</a> serves 20,000 residents each week in carrying out many self-serve transactions, inc; reporting missed bins, paying council tax, reporting anti-social behaviour, + many more!</p>

    <p class="profile">Prior to me joining Colchester Borough Council, there was a push to move away from a previous website supplier (and contract) which led to a rapid program of design and development. During that time, consideration for quality assurance, usability, web standards, accessibility, and user experience, was sacrificed for speed of delivery.</p>

    <h3 class="profile">The project</h3>

    <p class="profile">With such a vast program of work being delivered in such a short period of time, there was some reluctance to acknowledge and address the apparent issues.</p>

    <p class="profile">Through the use of overwhelming negative customer feedback and user testing, I was able to peel away the reluctant barriers and begin to bring stakeholders along a different journey. This journey was one of improving the customer experience.</p>

    <p class="profile">I proposed to move away from the 'big bang' approach to website design. Rather than rip up what had been done and go on a 2 year+ crusade to design and develop a new site, I suggested that we approach the redesign in an iterative manner.</p>

    <p class="profile">This iterative manner began by highlighting patterns across the site; recurring page types, transactions, processes, and user journeys. Improving these patterns would make highly noticeable changes to the website.</p>

    <p class="profile">A design system was developed in order to create much needed consistency that was not previously present. As an example of the situation, during a review of the current website, I recorded 15 different action styles (buttons and links) on a single page - this resulted in customers having to work extremely hard to know where to interact with the site.</p>

    <p class="profile">We consciously and blatantly took inspiration from the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">Gov.uk design system</a> which GDS actively encourage. Central Government have spent a lot of time and money to create a design system (and service language) that meet the needs of customers. Rather than ignore their learnings and start again, we intelligently used the Gov.uk design system to inform our own.</p>

    <h3 class="profile">What was learnt</h3>

    <p class="profile">I have learnt that whilst our initial approach was to iterate fast and hard, Local Government does work at it's own pace. Rather than push against this and potentially fail to bring stakeholders along the journey, we have been iterating in the background with a dev site. Once we're in a position that we're given the green light, we'll be able to roll out a program of pushes to the live site that will make dramatic and instant improvements to the customer experience on <a href="https://www.colchester.gov.uk/">colchester.gov.uk</a>.</p>
