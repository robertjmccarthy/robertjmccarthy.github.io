    <h3 class="profile-heading">The challenge</h3>
    <p class="profile">Take a decade old website builder system; upgrade, update, and improve, whilst retaining an established customer base.</p>
    <p class="profile"><strong>My role(s):</strong> Product Lead / Manager, Information Architect, and Digital Designer</p>
    <p class="profile"><strong>Project length:</strong> 12 months</p>

    <h3 class="profile-heading">The project</h3>
    <p class="profile">Websites4Pubs had a fully functional website builder for the pub industry, but the system was a decade old. The system had become bloated with features, the UI had been left untouched, and customer acquisition was non-existent.</p>
    <p class="profile">Working within a small product development team, our strategy was simple; keep existing customers happy on the current system (whatever it took), whilst developing a new system.</p>
    <p class="profile">At the early stages of the project, we engaged with existing customers who were invaluable for user research, and for creating use cases. The prioritisation of features was key to managing ‘the possible’, and this was driven by conversations with existing customers as well as usage data logged in the existing system.</p>
    <p class="profile">Whilst the existing system was extensively feature rich, we found a number of features that were unused. These features never made it onto our roadmap.</p>

    <p class="profile">As a small development team, we were working in a highly collaborative way throughout the entire project. Whilst working with 2 x full stack developers, I was responsible for the information architecture, UI and UX design, as well as product ownership and management.</p>
    <p class="profile">I created a design system that worked across a website builder, account system, and site management system. Creating this design system enabled the development team to apply a consistent and coherent UI whilst I continued to work on information architecture for further features.</p>

    <h3 class="profile-heading">What was learnt?</h3>
    <p class="profile">With a small team, building a new product whilst keeping an existing one going is hard... really hard.</p>
