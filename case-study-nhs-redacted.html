    <h3 class="profile-heading">The challenge</h3>
    <p class="profile"><a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/urgent-care-self-service-tool">NHS Digital</a> provide a self-triage product for patients to use in busy A&E departments across the UK. The product helps to alleviate pressures on A&E departments by redirecting patients, when appropriate, to other services.</p>
    <p class="profile">In early 2022, I joined a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) tasked with taking the product out of MVP and developing it as a live-service.</p>
    <p class="profile"><strong>My role(s):</strong> Interaction Designer</p>
    <p class="profile"><strong>Project length:</strong> Ongoing</p>

    <h3 class="profile-heading">Product improvements</h3>
    <p class="profile">The MDT were tasked with prioritising a number of items in the team's backlog. These included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce the number of patients coming away from an 'emergency catch' screen.</li>
      <li>Improve patient onboarding to the product so the purpose of using the product is better understood.</li>
      <li>Improve patient NHS number matching.</li>
      <li>Where patients are redirected to a different service, provide the patient with a choice of services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="profile-heading">Discovery</h3>
    <p class="profile">Before starting these pieces of work, I started with establishing a problem statement to understand why we were making these improvements to the product. These problem statements helped guide the entire MDT to a common goal.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="caption"><strong><i>Problem statement</strong><br>Forming a north star and creating a shared base of knowledge</i></p>

    <p class="profile">After establishing a problem statement, I worked with members of the MDT to carry out a discovery stage to surface information on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What we know about the problem and what can be evidenced through research</li>
      <li>What data do we have to support the problem</li>
      <li>What assumptions are we making</li>
      <li>How might we solve the problem</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="profile">Where we were improving specific journeys of the product, an activity I would undertake during the discovery stage was to map out the AS-IS. This surfaced how the product currently behaved and proved to be essential in assisting other members of the MDT to carry out their work.</p>

    <h3 class="profile-heading">Iterate, test... go again.</h3>
    <p class="profile">Using the NHS design system and pattern library, I progressed design ideations through:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>sketching and wireframes,</li>
      <li>using Figma for hi-fidelity designs and stakeholder reviews,</li>
      <li>and coding functional prototypes in HTML/CSS.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="profile">The User Researcher in our MDT involved me in the planning, observing and analysis of qualatative research sessions to test our assumptions, analyse user interactions with the prototypes, and use insights to inform further iterations.</p>

    <h3 class="profile-heading">The results</h3>
    <p class="profile">All tasks are in development and going live. Data will need to be gathered and analysed to test the product updates and quantatatively determine whether they are improvements.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="caption"><strong><i>Before / After</strong><br>Task: Where patients are redirected to a different service, provide the patient with a choice of services.</i></p>

    <p class="profile">Whilst it may be too early to report results of these individual pieces of work, it's well known that pressures on the NHS are increasing day-on-day. This product has had 270,000 patient interactions to date, and with further research, design and development, this product will continue to alleviate pressures on A&E whilst improving patient care and experience.</p>
